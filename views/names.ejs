    <h1>Data Structure Names and Definitions</h1>
    
    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">Treap = Tree + Heap</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A treap is a real data structure that combines the properties of a binary search tree and a heap. It supports efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations, maintaining balance like a tree while keeping heap properties intact.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Maintaining a dynamically balanced tree while also organizing data efficiently using heap priorities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">HeapTree = Heap + Tree</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> This refers to a tree structure where each node satisfies heap properties (either min-heap or max-heap). It could also represent a binary heap stored in tree form.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Efficient priority queue operations (insert, delete, find min/max) while visualizing it as a tree structure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">PyramidTree = Pyramid + Tree</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Represents a structure that is visually a "pyramid" (broad at the base, narrowing at the top), resembling a tree with levels. This could be tied to heap-like structures visualized in a pyramid shape.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Efficient hierarchical organization, potentially useful for tasks like hierarchical clustering or triangular matrices in graphics or geometry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">TreePyramid = Tree + Pyramid</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A reverse pyramid where each node leads to multiple children, forming a broad base as you descend levels. This could reflect a multi-level tree hierarchy, such as an organizational chart or file structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Efficiently handling hierarchical data that grows outward with more connections at lower levels, such as decision trees or hierarchical clustering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">HeapPyramid = Heap + Pyramid</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Similar to PyramidTree, but with more focus on heap properties combined with pyramid-like organization. It can represent triangular heaps or pyramidal sorting algorithms.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Efficient data retrieval where the highest or lowest priority elements are accessed from a pyramid-shaped heap, much like a priority queue but visualized geometrically.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">TreeStack = Tree + Stack</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> This could represent a combination of a tree traversal (e.g., depth-first search) using a stack as an auxiliary structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Efficient tree traversal using a stack, such as iterative depth-first search (DFS) to avoid recursion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">PileTree = Pile + Tree</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A pile represents an unordered heap of elements, and combining it with a tree could represent a multi-way tree where nodes are grouped in a pile-like manner (unsorted subtrees).</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Efficient grouping or partitioning of data elements in a loosely structured tree, potentially useful in scenarios like garbage collection or binomial heaps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="name-section">
        <span class="item">StackHeap = Stack + Heap</span>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A stack and heap combination could represent a structure where the most recently added elements (from a stack) follow heap ordering.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong> Managing data with both LIFO (Last In First Out) and priority-based access, useful in scenarios like task scheduling or memory management (stack-based heap allocation).</p>
    </div>
